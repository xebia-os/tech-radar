# Languages & Frameworks

## Java 11
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

### Why Java 11?

* Java 11 is the most recently released Java version that has long term support.  Long Term Support (or LTS) is a stable release that is maintained for longer period of time than the standard edition.

* There are many features introduced in Java since version 1.8 so you should seriously consider moving to the JDK 11. Some of these features are:

  * New methods in many widely used class like String, Stream class, List, etc.
  * JShell for quick prototyping (introduced in JDK 9)
  * `var` keyword(introduced in JDK 10). This feature is to reduce boilerplate variable type definitions and to increase code readability.
  * HTTP Client API. It supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
  * A low latency garbage collector called ZGC
  * Launch Single-File source code programs. You can now write Java scripts.
  * And many other features

## Flask
Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability to scale up to complex applications.

### Why ?
Flask  is a micro framework. The framework gives you a very convenient way of defining endpoints, handling the request data and building the HTTP responses. It does have a templating engine built-in which is very easy to use but just as easy to replace it should you prefer another module for it. There are plenty of Flask extensions available for caching, managing CORS headers or exposing metrics.

Project Reactor and the Spring portfolio work together to enable developers to build enterprise-grade reactive systems that are responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven.
### Why ?
Spring WebFlux is reactive-stack web framework, positioned as a successor of well-known and widely used Spring Web MVC. The primary purposes of creating a new framework were to support:

* a non-blocking approach which makes it possible to handle concurrency with a small number of threads and to scale effectively,
* functional programming, which helps write more declarative code with the usage of fluent APIs.

The most important new features are functional endpoints, event loop concurrency model and reactive Netty server.

# Tools and Techniques

## Evolutionary database design
Evolutionary database design involves incremental improvements to the database schema so that it can be continuously updated with changes for the new requirements of the systems. The technique takes away the need to have an upfront DB schema designs.

### Why
The technique applies agile practices to Database modeling. We model the data aspects of a system iteratively and incrementally. Database scripts are part of the project and are deployed along-with the application. This makes sure that the systems is always up-to-date with the latest changes taking away the need to coordinate changes with different teams.

## TDD
Test–Driven Development (TDD) is a minimalistic software development process in which the tests are written before the actual code. By doing so, the method ensures maximum alignment between the requirements and the production code

### Why ?
Tests are a MUST! The typical advantages we list when it comes to talking about TDD are :

* We write better software
* We have protection from breaking the world when new features are introduced
* The software is self documented
* We avoid over-engineering

## Contract First
When using contract-first, we start with the API contract, and use code to implement said contract. Contract must be prepares using open-api specification. The contract can be written in YAML or JSON file.

### Why ?
Following are the advantages of Contract First
* The service provider and consumer teams Can Develop in Parallel
* Since the contract is established, so the producer and consumer teams have an idea of each others' expectations. This also helps in preparing the  test platforms as stubs can be developed to mock the other's behaviour, all based on the contract.
* It also enables Reuse of existing APIs to deliver the new usecases.
* Consistent API behaviours
