# Languages & Frameworks

## Java 11
Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 

### Why Java 11?

* Java 11 is the most recently released Java version that has long term support.  Long Term Support (or LTS) is a stable release that is maintained for longer period of time than the standard edition.

* There are many features introduced in Java since version 1.8 so you should seriously consider moving to the JDK 11. Some of these features are:

  * New methods in many widely used class like String, Stream class, List, etc.
  * JShell for quick prototyping (introduced in JDK 9)
  * `var` keyword(introduced in JDK 10). This feature is to reduce boilerplate variable type definitions and to increase code readability.
  * HTTP Client API. It supports both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2
  * A low latency garbage collector called ZGC
  * Launch Single-File source code programs. You can now write Java scripts.
  * And many other features
